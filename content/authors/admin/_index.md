Hi! Currently I am working on my PhD deticated to detection of viruses in plant metagenomes using deep learning. I love doing projects in DL, ML and data analytics. Molecular phylogenetics is not foreign to me, as my master thesis referred to it a lot.

In the spare time I love doing yoga and meditation, traveling and taking photos.
